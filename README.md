# Food and Beverage SOA - CA1 Documentation
During the development of this CA, a rangeof resources was used for learning and troubleshooting. Below is an acknowledgment of these resources, along with brief descriptions of how they helped me with the project.

## Educational Resources
### User Controls in C# 
To grasp the concept of user controls within C# applications, I found a helpful tutorial. This series provided an understanding guide on creating and managing custom user controls aswell as inspired my design.

### JSON File Handling: 
Understanding the serialization and deserialization processes in C# was crucial for managing the application's data storage. The following article explained the usage of JsonSerializer for reading and writing JSON data to files.
